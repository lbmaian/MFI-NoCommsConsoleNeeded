# More Faction Interaction Patch - No Comms Console Needed
Patch for the RimWorld [More Faction Interaction (MFI) mod](https://github.com/Mehni/MoreFactionInteraction) to remove the powered comms console requirement for its incidents.

This is primarily to allow medieval/tribal-only playthroughs to have full access to MFI features.

There are currently only a couple MFI incidents that require a powered comms console, which this patches out:

* Mystical shaman
* Roadworks
* Reverse trade request
* Pirate extortion
* Wounded combatants (allied faction involved in faction war requests permission to arrive with wounded)  
  Note: Pawns still arrive in drop pods.
