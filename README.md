# More Faction Interaction Patch - No Comms Console Needed
Patch/submod for the RimWorld [More Faction Interaction (MFI) mod](https://github.com/Mehni/MoreFactionInteraction) to remove the powered comms console requirement for its incidents.

This is primarily to allow medieval/tribal-only playthroughs to have full access to MFI features.

There are currently only a couple MFI incidents that require a powered comms console, which this patches out:
* Mystical shaman  
  Also patches the requirement that there must exist a non-hostile neolithic (tribal) faction (that the shaman belongs to) such that only a non-hostile faction of any tech level is required.
* Roadworks
* Reverse trade request
* Pirate extortion
* Wounded combatants (allied faction involved in faction war requests permission to arrive with wounded)  
  Note: Pawns still arrive in drop pods, and the dialog still talks about transport pods, radios, mortars, etc.
