  <description><![CDATA[<b>More Faction Interaction Patch - No Comms Console Needed</b>

Patch/submod for the RimWorld [More Faction Interaction (MFI) mod] to both:
1. Remove the powered comms console requirement for some of its incidents.
2. Allow the silver that is needed for some of its incidents to be in any storage/stockpile rather than within the range of trade beacons. That is, it uses the same "what items are reachable to be sold" logic as in-map trading with visiting trade caravans.

This is primarily to allow medieval/tribal-only playthroughs to have full access to MFI features.

The following MFI incidents are patched to both remove the need for a powered comms console and allow the silver fee to paid from any storage/stockpile (rather than near trade beacons):
* Mystical shaman
  Also patches the requirement that there must exist a non-hostile neolithic (tribal) faction (that the shaman belongs to) such that only a non-hostile non-player faction of any tech level is required.
* Roadworks
* Reverse trade request
* Pirate extortion
* Wounded combatants (allied faction involved in faction war requests permission to arrive with wounded)
  Note: Pawns still arrive in drop pods, and the dialog still talks about transport pods, radios, mortars, etc.
* (Vanilla incident) Ransom demand
